### Purpose

This is my protfolio website and the purpose of this website is to demonstrate my technical skills in designing and development. Desigining  a website takes time and it needs proper planning and documentation. This website will  show my project planning ability to perform any task. It demonstrates my capabilities to plan, design, implement and deploy a website.

This will improve my exposure to others in the industry.  Potential employer will be able to know a little bit about myself through this website. More than that it is also a way to utilise my skills that I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, SASS and Git) by building this website.



### Functationality and Features

The website was built with simplicty and cleanness in mind, so that there is less distraction for the users. However, I have  used some features  to engage the user and make it easier to navigate.



### 1. Navigation Bar

Navigation bar is used in top of every page of the website. Users can navigate to other pages like home,     projects, about and contact page through navigation bar, since it will have link to all other pages. A blue hover effect is used to better guide the user and also tell the user that the feature is interactable. 

The navigation bar also inform visiotors about the all th pages they will be able to visit.

### 2. Sticky navgation bar

Sticky navigation bar is used so that even the pages go longer in the future as more contents are added, user will not get lost. And they will always find the way to return to their desired page through navigation bar as it stays where it is and does not get lost with scrolling.

### 3. Skill bar

Skill bar is used to show my skills in different programming languages in About me page. Color bar and percentage is given to give better picture of my skills in different languages. It gives potential employer my skill level; however this will change as I keep on updating my skills and will only improve over time.

### 4. Download button

Download button is added in the About me page. By clicking the download button potential employer will be able to download my PDF copy of CV. 

It is in the buttom of the page and has also hover effect to show it is clickable. The link is large, bolded and has download image in the button. 



### 5. Shadow effect in the Project page

To show all the projects that I have done so far, shadow effect is used for the boxes in the project page. This makes the boxes more distinct from rest of the page. Also, to go to the actual project in the Github, the whole image and the headings are made clickable, which is linked to the actual Github website.



### 6. Contact page changing hover effect

In the contact page, when the the visitors will hover over the email address, mobile number or social page, it will not only hover but also the box size will change. The color of the text will also change while hovering. This will keep user more interested in the page. Big bold hover effect is used with blue colors. 

### 7. Social page icons

For potential employer or visitors to link with me or know more about me, social page icons are used. The icons have hover effect and will change color when hovered. These icons will link to my actual social pages. The icons are used in Landing page and contact page.
