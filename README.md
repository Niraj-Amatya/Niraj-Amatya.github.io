### Purpose

This is my protfolio website and the purpose of this website is to demonstrate my technical skills in designing and development. Desigining  a website takes time and it needs proper planning and documentation. This website will  show my project planning ability to perform any task. It demonstrates my capabilities to plan, design, implement and deploy a website.

This will improve my exposure to others in the industry.  Potential employer will be able to know a little bit about myself through this website. More than that it is also a way to utilise my skills that I have learned so far (HTML, CSS, SASS and Git) by building this website.



### Functationality and Features

The website was built with simplicty and cleanness in mind, so that there is less distraction for the users. However, I have  used some features  to engage the user and make it easier to navigate.



### 1. Navigation Bar

Navigation bar is used in top of every page of the website. Users can navigate to other pages like home,     projects, about and contact page through navigation bar, since it will have link to all other pages. A blue hover effect is used to better guide the user and also tell the user that the feature is interactable. 

The navigation bar also inform visiotors about the all th pages they will be able to visit.

### 2. Sticky navgation bar

Sticky navigation bar is used so that even the pages go longer in the future as more contents are added, user will not get lost. And they will always find the way to return to their desired page through navigation bar as it stays where it is and does not get lost with scrolling. 











### 3. Skill bar





The site will include a navigation bar, which will include links to the other main pages of the website - home, projects, blog, and CV - on each page. The navigation bar both informs visitors of the other pages available on the website, and allows them a way to visit them.

The navigation bar resides at the top of each page so the user will always know where they can go on each page to navigate around the website. A yellow hover effect is used on the text for each page to provide feedback to the user that the feature is interactable. The fact that yellow features are interactable will be used repeatedly on the website.

A footer bar is included with links to professional accounts - LinkedIn and Github - as well as a link which will open an email message to my email address. This will allow visitors to view additional information such as my career prior to tech, personal projects, and allow them to get in contact with me if they wish.
